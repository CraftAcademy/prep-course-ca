## Coding as a Craft Bootcamp prep
 **A prep course for junior web developers.**

### Coding as a Craft - in 12 weeks
Craft Academy is a 12-week intensive, practice-oriented course for aspiring junior developers. The course is delivered as a coding bootcamp by Craft Academy in Gothenburg, Sweden. It gives you the basics you need to create, develop and launch web-based applications.

The aim is to teach you the fundamentals of web development, enabling you to hit the ground running â€“ and keep running. But what is important is that modern engineering practices are considered to be part of this foundation. As a student, you'll work from day one with **automated testing**, **continuous integration and deployment**, and other essential skills. This means that when you enter the workforce and are faced with a problem, your instinct will be to solve intelligently rather than just hacking a solution together.

### Open Source
This publication contains the course materials we ask all our future students to go through. You are free to use it for your personal learning needs even if you are not attending our bootcamp; we encourage that.

**It is, however, not allowed to use this material in a commercial context without our written consent. It is not okay and it is against the very meaning of open source.**
