During the Craft Academy Bootcamp we will be working with technologies across the entire stack behind a web application. Let's just quickly go over the differences and their meaning. We will cover technologies in italics during the main bootcamp.

### Front End
The front end of a website is the part that users interact with. Everything that you see when you're navigating a website, from fonts and colors to dropdown menus, sliders and forms. The front end is a combo of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript controlled by your computer's browser.

#### Technologies used
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

### Back end
The back end of a website consists of a server, an application and a database. A back-end developer builds and maintains the technology that powers the components that enables the front end side of a website to exist in the first place.

#### Technologies used
* PHP
* Ruby
* Python
* Java
* .Net
* SQL (MySql, Postgres, etc.)
* NoSQL (MongoDB)

### Full stack
Full stack developers work mostly on the server side of web programming, but they can also speak the front-end languages that control how content looks on a web site's user-facing side.

Craft Academy is a full-stack bootcamp. We use Ruby as a back-end language with frameworks like Sinatra and Rails. For front end development, we use Javascript and JS frameworks like AngularJS and Ionic.
